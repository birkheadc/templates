# Birkheadc's Templates

These are the templates I use when creating apps.

I've gotten tired of writing the same boilerplate and config files over and over again, every time I want to start something new. It's also annoying that I find myself opening up my last project and using it as a reference whenever I can't forget something about babel or webpack config or whatever, and having to remember what parts are necessary, and what parts were specific to that project. So I decided to create (and hopefully maintain) a repository of basic templates, with instructions and documentation on how to use them.
