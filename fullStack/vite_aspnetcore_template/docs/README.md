# Vite + ASP.NET Core Template
Latest generalized template I am creating for creating a web application with a front end built with Vite and React, and a back end built with ASP.NET Core.

Started: 2024-06-21

## Goals
I started this template after a frustrating experience building my first app with my previous template, which used NestJS in the front end and NestJS in the back.

Some of my frustrations were because of my own bad choices, but others were because of those choices in framework. I don't mean to disparage them, and I am glad I took the time to learn them, but they left me wanting a different experience.

That, combined with a desire to go back to the drawing board on a number of other issues, led to me creating this template.

### Strongly-Typed API
I have always liked C# and .NET, and spending a lot of time working with TypeScript has only made me more homesick. NestJS was great, but I couldn't constantly feeling that it was great *despite* JavaScript, not *because* of it. I am excited to go back to ASP.NET and discover how it has grown since I've been away.

### Back to Pure React
I originally started using NextJS because it seemed like what everyone was doing. But the more I used it, the more I realized that I wasn't getting much out of it, and I missed my own miniature React framework(s) I had developed. This time I'll be trying out Vite, hopefully for a slimmer approach.

### OAuth
I'll be learning and implementing OAuth (finally).

### Embracing Cloud During Development
Rather than attempting to replicate the entire cloud stack locally when developing, I'm going to attempt to embrace the use of Staging resources and services during development.

### Testing
I'm going to aim for higher test coverage, especially in front end components, integration, and e2e. I mean it this time.
