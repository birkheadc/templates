# Todo

- Maybe create integration tests?

- Readme needs a lot of updating. Best do it while I still remember what I've done and why

- Font size / overall style on mobile needs work. More padding / bigger nav links / further from edge of screen. Maybe slightly bigger font.

- Add link to the template github / info on the template / the template's readme to home might be nifty.
