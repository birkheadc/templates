# Todo

- Build login functionality in backend. It should default to `admin`/`password` being the only working credentials.
- Configure front-end to use the backend endpoint.

- Configure serverless to create all the necessary services when deploying, including databases
  - First, we need an auth database for user(s)
- Check to make sure it all works when deployed, offline and to aws

- Maybe create an integration test?
