# Todo

- Configure serverless to create all the necessary services when deploying, including databases
  - First, we need an auth database for user(s)
- Check to make sure it all works when deployed, offline and to aws

- Maybe create an integration test?

- Add Settings page to front in with change password functionality
  - Add that functionality to backend
  - Need to add safeguards to stop:
    - Empty new password
    - Password and Confirm Password should match (on frontend only)
