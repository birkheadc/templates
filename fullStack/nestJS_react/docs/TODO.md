- Maybe create an integration test?

- MORE WORK ON GETTING SERVERLESS WORKING
  - try deploying to aws first and see if my config works properly
  - backend/serverless/seed.ts has region hard-coded, how to fix this?

- Readme needs a lot of updating. Best do it while I still remember what I've done and why
